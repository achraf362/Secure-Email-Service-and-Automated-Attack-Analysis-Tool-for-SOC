Secure Email Service and Automated Threat Analysis Tool
Project Overview
This project aims to set up a secure email service while developing an automated email threat analysis tool to assist SOC analysts. The focus is on detecting and mitigating email threats such as phishing, spam, and malware using artificial intelligence.

Features
Secure Email Service: Implementation of a secure messaging platform with Postfix, Dovecot, Zimbra, and Roundcube.
AI-Based Threat Detection: Integration of machine learning models to identify phishing and spam.
Email Security Protocols: Utilizes DKIM, SPF, and DMARC for email authentication and security.
Antivirus and Spam Filters: Implements ClamAV, SpamAssassin, and VirusTotal for advanced email threat detection.
Architecture
Network Configuration: Two companies connected via OSPF and RIP protocols.
Messaging Infrastructure: Combination of Postfix, Dovecot, and webmail clients (Zimbra, Roundcube).
Security Tools: Integration of security tools like Rspamd and Mailgraph for monitoring.
Installation and Setup
Install and configure Postfix, Dovecot, Zimbra, or Roundcube.
Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC for email validation.
Implement ClamAV, SpamAssassin, and VirusTotal for malware and spam detection.
